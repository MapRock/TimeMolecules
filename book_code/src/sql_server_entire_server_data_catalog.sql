/*

sql_server_entire_data_catalog.sql

This will fetch metadata of a SQL Server instance and return a table. This table is the source for a Cypher
script, load_data_catalog_into_neo4j.cql, which will import this metadata into a Neo4j Data Catalog.

Prior to running this script, metadata obtained from Kyvos cubes are imported into [STAGE].[kyvos_trial_cluster]

Remember to set NULL (it's a string if we save it) as blank.

table_uri and column_uri are meant to link to the Knowledge Graph. It might be the tail wagging the dog in that
the KG authors should probably set the uri for tables and columns - not the data catalog setting the uri for the KG authors.
But I have this script setting a default of the ontology#table_name or ontology#column_name to illustrate the concept of
mapping the KG to the data catalog.
