TimeMolecules_Code04.sql through TimeMolecules_Code75.sql reflect SQL code in the book, Time Molecules. Each is:

1. Run from the TimeSolution database (restored from TimeSolution.bak). My intent is to use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as the "query tool" for these SQL snippets.
2. Idempotent--meaning they can be run multiple times with no adverse side-effect to the TimeSolution database.

The gaps in numbering (ex. TimeMolecules_Code01.sql isn't in this folder because it doesn't fit the criteria I just listed.

In the future, this folder will house additional code reflecting further examples. They will be named outside of the TimeMolecules_CodeXX.sql pattern.
